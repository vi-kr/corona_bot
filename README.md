# corona_bot
Repository as a code backup for a discord bot

This is a repository for a discord bot that is only supposed to be run on my own discord server,
but could probably be used by anyone. It downloads data about the corona virus from the German RKI
and can send daily updates to a discord channel.

Comments etc are written in German, but this bot is only really useful in Germany anyway, as the data
from the RKI is only about Germany.
